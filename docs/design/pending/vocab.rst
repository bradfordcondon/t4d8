Controlled Vocabulary Design
==============================

This design document is attempting to describe our current design process for Controlled vocabularies, id spaces and terms in Tripal.

Tripal is very ontology-focused with public terms forming the basis of our content types and fields. This sets us up to support (1) rich semantic web ready web services, (2) detailed definitions for all content displayed to the user, and (3) intuitive and powerful search filters and facets.
